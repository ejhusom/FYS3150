# FYS3150 - Computational Physics
Source code written by Erik Johannes Husom, for projects in the course FYS3150 Computational Physics at the University of Oslo, autumn 2018.

## Project 1
Numerically solving the one-dimensional Poisson's Equation using the Three Point Method. Comparing the efficiency of a general Thomas algorithm, a specialized algorithm and LU decomposition.

## Project 2
Numerical solver for eigenvalue problems, used on a buckling beam problem and the Schroedinger Equation for one and two electrons in a harmonic oscillator potential.

## Project 3
Simulating the movement of astronomical objects in the solar system, by using the Velocity Verlet Method.

## Project 4
Simulating phase transitions with the Ising model in two dimensions.

## Project 5
N/A
