# FYS3150 - Computational Physics
Source code written by Erik Johannes Husom, for projects in the course FYS3150 Computational Physics at the University of Oslo, autumn 2018.

## Project 1 - Poisson's Equation
Numerically solving the one-dimensional Poisson's Equation using the Three Point Method. Comparing the efficiency of a general Thomas algorithm, a specialized algorithm and LU decomposition.

## Project 2 - Eigenvalue Problems
Numerical solver for eigenvalue problems, used on a buckling beam problem and the Schroedinger Equation for one and two electrons in a harmonic oscillator potential.

## Project 3 - The Solar System
Simulating the movement of astronomical objects in the solar system, by using the Velocity Verlet Method.

## Project 4 - The Ising Model
Modelling phase transitions with the Ising model in two dimensions, using the Metropolis algorithm.

## Project 5 - Diffusion Equation

The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  test  different  numerical  schemes  to
solve the diffusion equation and use it to look for evidence that support
geophysical studies of a subduction zone outside the western coast of Nor-
way.
