The functions of this project is split into multiple source files. Obtain an executable ```project2.x``` by running ```make``` in terminal. The executable can be run with no or several command line arguments:
- No cmd arg: Running tests and giving usage information
- First cmd arg: Number of mesh points.
- Second cmd arg: rho_Max, spherical coordinates, (optional).
- Third cmd arg: omega, strength of oscillator potential, (optional).

The python script ```dataplot.py``` creates all the plots of the project results, but requires certain pre-produced data files, which are not included in this repository.

All source code in this project is developed for Ubuntu 18.04 with C++ and Python 3.6.
